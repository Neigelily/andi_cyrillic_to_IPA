# Andi transliteration
This is a TECkit map for Bulk editor in SIL FieldWorks. It also can be used in SIL Convertes.
Mainly it use Andi alphabet (e. g. see [omniglot page](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/andi.htm)) with several additions:

* 1 and I (U+0049, Latin Capital letter I) can be used instead of ӏ (U+04CF, [ Cyrillic small letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)). Ӏ (U+04C0, [Cyrillic letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)) is not used in a converter.
* [je] after a vowel or in the begining of the word should be written as <йе>.
* as in work by Kh. Salimov uvular voiced stop ɢ is expected to be written in cyrillic as <кгъ>.
* nasal vowels are writen with tilde above (а̃, я̃) or with 2 (а2, и2).
