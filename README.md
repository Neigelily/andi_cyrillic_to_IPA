# Andi transliteration
This is a TECkit map for Bulk editor in SIL FieldWorks. It can be used in SIL Converters as well. It uses the Andi alphabet (e.g. see [omniglot page](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/andi.htm)) with several additions:

* <1> and <I> (U+0049, Latin Capital letter I) can be used instead of <ӏ> (U+04CF, [ Cyrillic small letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)). <Ӏ> (U+04C0, [Cyrillic letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)) is not used in the converter.
* [je] following a vowel or in word-initial position should be written as <йе>.
* As in Kh. Salimov's work, uvular voiced stop [ɢ] is expected to be written in cyrillic as <кгъ>.
* Nasal vowels are written either with a tilde above (e. g. <а̃>, <я̃>) or with a <2> following the vowel (e. g. <а2>, <и2>).
* sequence <лъ>  is by default ambiguous. We decided to use <лъ> to denote lateral fricative [ɬ] and <л.ъ> to denote sequences composed of the lateral approximant followed by a glottal stop [lʔ].
